An analysis of the impact COVID-19 has had on the stock price of selected UK construction companies,
compared to overall FTSE 100 market performance.

The top 5 UK construction companies were chosen based on Construction News article from Sept-2019:

https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/financial/cn100-2019-top-100-uk-contractors-05-09-2019/

Companies were only chosen where Yahoo finance data was available, final selection being:

Balfour Beatty, Kier, Galliford Try, Morgan Sindall, and Costain.

Historic FTSE 100 data obtained from https://uk.investing.com/indices/uk-100-historical-data, and saved as external CSV file
(a copy is included as part of this repo).

Stock data was taken from Yahoo finance, for the period 01/05/19 to 01/05/20, covering 6 months before and after COVID-19 became apparent
on 31/12/19.

This anlysis concludes by comparing the 30 day rolling average of the construction stocks noted above against the 30 day rolling
average of the FTSE 100 for the same period.

In general, it appears the construction sector was worse performing leading up to the pandemic commencing, followed by a brief period of
better performance. From mid-March 2020 the construction sector followed a similar trend as the rest of the FTSE 100, albeit with a bigger impact. This may be related to the UK lock down measures being discussed at that time.
